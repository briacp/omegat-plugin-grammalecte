# OmegaT Plugin - Grammalecte

## Description

Grammalecte is an open-source grammatical checker for French. This plugin enables OmegaT to check the current segment with Grammalecte and can provide suggestions. It acts like LanguageTool but has a different approach which gives better results (in my opinion).

Currently, this plugin requires a running Grammalecte server. The server can be downloaded on [Grammalecte website](https://grammalecte.net/grammalecte/zip/Grammalecte-fr-v1.5.0.zip).
