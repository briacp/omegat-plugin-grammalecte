# OmegaT Plugin - Grammalecte

## Description

Grammalecte is an open-source grammatical checker for French. This plugin enables OmegaT to check the current segment with Grammalecte and can provide suggestions. It acts like LanguageTool but has a different approach which gives better results (in my opinion).

Currently, this plugin requires a running Grammalecte server. The server can be downloaded on [Grammalecte website](https://grammalecte.net/grammalecte/zip/Grammalecte-fr-v1.5.0.zip).

## Installation

You can download the plugin jar file from the [release page](../../releases). The OmegaT plugin jar should be placed in `$HOME/.omegat/plugins` (Linux), `~/Library/Preferences/OmegaT/plugins/` (macOS), or `C:\Program Files\OmegaT\plugins` (Windows) depending on your operating system.
