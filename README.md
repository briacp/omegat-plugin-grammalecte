# OmegaT Plugin - Grammalecte

## Description

Grammalecte is an open-source grammatical checker for French. This plugins enables OmegaT to check the current segment with Grammalecte and can provide suggestions. It acts like LanguageTool but has a different approach which gives better (in my opinion) results.

Currently, this This plugin requires a running Grammalecte server. It can be downloaded on [Grammalecte website](https://grammalecte.net/grammalecte/zip/Grammalecte-fr-v1.5.0.zip).
